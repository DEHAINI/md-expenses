In regards to Mahmoudâ€™s technical test we have some feedback

    The documentation was very good
    The implementation of the RESTful API was not correct.

The urls for the RESTful API should be:

List expenses: GET http://localhost/v1/expenses

Create an expense: POST http://localhost/v1/expenses

Get single expense: GET http://localhost/v1/expenses/{id}

Update expense: PUT http://localhost/v1/expenses/{id}

Delete expense: DELETE http://localhost/v1/expenses/{id}

Where {id} refers to the ID of the expense

Unit tests should not be dependent on data from a previous unit test. The tests should be able to run independently or in a random order.

There are too many if else statements in his service methods making the code difficult to read. Consider following the return early concept (https://szymonkrajewski.pl/why-should-you-return-early/) to make the code more readable.
